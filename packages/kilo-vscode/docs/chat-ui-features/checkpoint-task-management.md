# Checkpoint & Task Management

**Priority:** P1
**Status:** ❌ Not started

## Remaining Work

- Checkpoint restore dialogs
- Checkpoint navigation menu / timeline
- "See New Changes" buttons to view git diffs for completed tasks
- Integration with CLI session undo/redo/fork operations
- Consider reusing kilo-ui's `MessageNav` component (used by the desktop app but not yet by this extension)
