# Message Editing & Management

**Priority:** P1
**Status:** ❌ Not started

## Remaining Work

- Edit user messages inline (with full chat input features — mode selector, image attachments, cancel/save)
- Delete user messages from conversation
- Click-to-edit on message text
- Timestamp display on messages
- Redo previous message via up-arrow key
- Map edit/delete to CLI session operations (fork-from-message + re-run) since CLI is the source of truth for session history
