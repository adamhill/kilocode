# Settings Sync Integration

**Priority:** P3
**Status:** ❌ Not started

## Remaining Work

- Register allowlist of extension state/settings for VS Code Settings Sync
- Determine which settings should sync (extension settings in `settings.json` vs CLI config)
- Optionally mirror a subset of settings into CLI config
