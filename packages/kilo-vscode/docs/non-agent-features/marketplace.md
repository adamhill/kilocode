# Marketplace (Installable Modes, MCP Servers, Skills)

**Priority:** P2
**Status:** ❌ Not started

## What Exists

- Toolbar button registered (`kilo-code.new.marketplaceButtonClicked`) with `$(extensions)` icon
- Renders `<DummyView title="Marketplace" />` — a placeholder with no functionality

## Remaining Work

- Catalog browsing (Modes, MCP servers, Skills)
- Install/uninstall/update capabilities
- Marketplace API endpoints (may need backend work)
- Search and filtering within the catalog
