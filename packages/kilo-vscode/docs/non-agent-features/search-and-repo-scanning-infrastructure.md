# Search & Repo Scanning Infrastructure

**Priority:** P2
**Status:** ❌ Not started

## What Exists

- `findFiles()` for fuzzy filename matching via CLI `/find/file` endpoint (used for `@` mentions)

## Remaining Work

- Search UI for grep/glob results within VS Code
- Result previews and navigation
- Extension-side search infrastructure (currently all search tools are CLI backend-only)
