# Repository Initialization

**Priority:** P3
**Status:** ❌ Not started

## Remaining Work

- Command or button to initialize a repository for agentic engineering
- Creates configuration files (e.g., AGENTS.md, .kilocode/ directory)
- Detects existing project structure and tailors initialization
- May scaffold rules, workflows, or skill configurations
- Accessible from VS Code command palette and/or chat UI
- Determine if this calls a CLI `/init` endpoint or replicates CLI logic
- Progress/status feedback during initialization
