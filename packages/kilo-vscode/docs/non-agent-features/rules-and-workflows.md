# Rules & Workflows

**Priority:** P3
**Status:** 🔨 Partial

## What Exists

- Rules subtab in AgentBehaviour settings allows managing instruction file paths (add/remove paths like `./INSTRUCTIONS.md`), persisted to `config.instructions`

## Remaining Work

- Workflow management UI (currently a `<Placeholder>` stub in AgentBehaviour settings)
- Workflow definition and execution format
- UI for browsing `.kilocode/rules/` and similar rule sources
- Determine CLI endpoints for workflow CRUD
- Related to [Custom Commands](custom-command-system.md) and [Skills System](skills-system.md)
