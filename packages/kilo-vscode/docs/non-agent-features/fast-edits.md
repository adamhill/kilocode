# Fast Edits (Diff-Based Editing)

**Priority:** P2
**Status:** ❌ Not started

## Remaining Work

- Fast edit mode for quick inline code changes (apply diffs/patches rather than rewriting full files)
- VS Code-specific diff/preview/confirmation UX
- Match-precision tuning
- CLI has fast-edit runtime — extension needs UI integration
