# Skills System

**Priority:** P2
**Status:** 🔨 Partial

## What Exists

- AgentBehaviour settings "skills" subtab manages skill paths (local directories) and skill URLs (remote endpoints), persisted to `config.skills.paths` and `config.skills.urls`

## Remaining Work

- Skill execution runtime integration in the extension
- Skill discovery (browse available skills)
- Hot-reload when skill files change
- CLI has the skills runtime — extension needs UI beyond config management
