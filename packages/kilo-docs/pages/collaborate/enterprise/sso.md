# SSO

Kilo Enterprise lets your organization securely manage access using **Single Sign-On (SSO)**. With SSO enabled, team members can sign in to Kilo using your company's existing identity provider, such as Okta, Github, Google Workspace, etc.

{% callout type="warning" %}
**IDP-initiated logins are not currently supported.** Users must navigate to the [Kilo Web App](https://app.kilo.ai) to log in. Logging in directly from your identity provider's dashboard is not supported at this time.
{% /callout %}

## Prerequisites

You’ll need:

- Admin or Owner permissions for your Kilo organization.
- Access to your **Identity Provider (IdP)** (e.g. Okta, Google Workspace, Azure AD).

## Initiating SSO Configuration

### 1. Open [Organization](https://app.kilo.ai/organizations) Dashboard

Find the Single Sign-On (SSO) Configuration panel, and click "Set up SSO":

### 2. Submit the SSO Request Form

Fill in your contact information and someone from our team will reach out soon to help you configure SSO.

## Implementing SSO Configuration

Once the Kilo team has enabled SSO for your organization, your named admin will get an email from WorkOS to configure SSO.

{% callout type="warning" %}
**Save domain policy for last.**

If you configure domain policy before setting up SSO, you may lock users out of Kilo.
{% /callout %}

Your admin will need to use the WorkOS link to:

### Configure your Identity Provider in WorkOS

Find the Metadata in your Identity Provider and apply that configuration in WorkOS.

### Configure WorkOS in your Identity Provider

Copy the Service Provider details (Entity ID, ACS URL, and Metadata) from the WorkOS dashboard and apply them in your Identity Provider.

### Configure Policy and Domain Settings in WorkOS

1. Set the organization policy and user provisioning settings according to your organization's needs.
2. Configure domain policy and domain verification in WorkOS.

After enabling SSO:

- Invite new users with their company email domain.
- Manage team access and roles from the **[Organization](/docs/collaborate/adoption-dashboard/overview)** tab.
- View user activity across the team in the **[Audit Logs](/docs/collaborate/enterprise/audit-logs)** tab
