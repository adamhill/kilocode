            Closing this one out since it's been inactive for a while — not because it's a bad issue, just that older items tend to lose context over time and we'd rather start fresh if this is still a problem.

            Please feel free to reopen (or open a new issue) if you're still running into this. We're happy to take another look! 🙏
