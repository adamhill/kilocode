# Kilocode Change Markers

When modifying shared code (files that exist in upstream opencode), use `kilocode_change` markers to identify Kilo Code-specific changes.

## When markers are NOT needed

Code in these paths is Kilo Code-specific and does NOT need `kilocode_change` markers:

- `packages/opencode/src/kilocode/` - All files in this directory
- `packages/opencode/test/kilocode/` - All test files for kilocode
- Any other path containing `kilocode` in filename or directory name

These paths are entirely Kilo Code additions and won't conflict with upstream.
